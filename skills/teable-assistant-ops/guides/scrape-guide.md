# Scraping Guide

Use scraping for structured records from supported platforms, not as a generic page fetcher. Fetch ordinary or unsupported pages directly.

## Dataset and mode selection

1. Consult the curated reference. For a specific page, choose the stable URL-collector dataset; for search results, feeds, profile posts, categories, or hashtags, choose the matching `*_by_*` discovery dataset.
2. If no curated choice supports the requested mode, use `scrape search` with the platform plus data type. Its raw `gd_` result includes collector inputs and discovery modes.
3. For a raw `gd_` discovery mode, pass its `discoverBy` value and exactly that mode's input fields. Preserve field names and JSON types; similar datasets often use different names such as `keyword`, `keywords`, or `search_keyword`.

Batch inputs only when they share a dataset ID and mode. Keep the default result limit unless the user asks for more: feeds, searches, and comment lists bill per returned record, while a single-page collector still yields one record.

```bash
teable scrape search --query "glassdoor company reviews"
teable scrape run --dataset-id gd_XXXX --discover-by keyword --inputs '[{"keyword":"database engineer","location":"Berlin"}]' --limit 20
```

## Asynchronous results

`teable scrape run` starts the job and immediately returns a snapshot ID. Retain it and fetch the result with status polling; a wait of up to 120 seconds can reduce repeated calls.

```bash
teable scrape status --snapshot-id s_XXXX --wait 60
```

If the status remains pending, repeat **status** with the same snapshot ID. Never rerun `scrape run` for the same inputs: that starts and bills a second job rather than resuming the first.
